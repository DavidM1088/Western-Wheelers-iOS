Welcome to the ride location quiz. The quiz rides are sampled from the Western Wheelers Long Distance Training and Fall Fun Series ride series and many other rides listed by the club.

Most of quiz rides are within 40 miles of Palo Alto and many are within 20 miles. Sorry, some of the images are hard to read on a phone. The quiz rides will be updated from time to time. Thanks for playing.
